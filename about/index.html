                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
                <p>I'm a machine learning engineer, I most recently worked at <a href="https://www.tidal.com" target="_blank">TIDAL</a>, where I worked on developing green field projects focused on serving artists, prior I was on Square (now Block) working on credit risk. I have a background in Computer Science (bachelor's degree), and I've spent my time focusing on applied ML.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Before landing at Square I was moving around opportunities breaking into the industry without a masters/phd, and got in with some contract work at small fintechs, and finally a startup (now acquired) called Summatti focusing on creating automated CSAT scores for customer service teams. </p><br>
                <p>In my time as an undergrad I managed to join <a href="https://nextconlab.ca/" target="_blank">NextCon</a> at uOttawa as a researcher, and published several papers in computer vision, primarily in developing applied solutions for an industry partner. You can find my published work on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bW_5_xsAAAAJ" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>.</p>
