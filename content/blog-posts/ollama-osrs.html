<h3>Fish lvl?</h3>
<p>Since I've always had an interest (personal + professional) in NLP, a natural fit for a post here are some experiments in automating chat in runescape. Time to hook in LLMs.</p>
<p>I know everyone's thinking it "Why can't MMOs stop being social?", well we can solve that. We can aim to experiment with how to best get llms to respond when someone addresses us, or maybe engage with them ü§î</p>

<h3>Baseline Check</h3>
<p>So first, I want to check if any models out of the box can do well in just chatting like a player or if they know anything about the game.</p>
<p>
    Using <a href="https://ollama.com/" target="_blank">Ollama</a> and <a href="https://openwebui.com/" target="_blank">OpenWebUI</a>, it's pretty easy to test out multiple models on a task, so let's setup a baseline prompt we'll test out<br><br>
    I'm running this all on my local desktop with a rtx 3090 (24gb vram), threadripper 1950X 16 core, and 64gb ram.

<pre><code><u>System prompt</u>
You're a player interacting in the world of runescape. 
You're trying to blend in with the crowd and go with what's being said to you, and will match the energy of whatever is being said. 
Keep your responses extremely brief, use common acronyms, make sure you aren't suspicious (in this context, being suspicious means speaking verbosely).
    
You'll need to know some terminology and context from the game, so here's some examples:
    Wildy: Wilderness, a pvp zone where you are in danger of being attacked by other players and losing all items your carrying
    gf: Either good fight (said after a fight), or girlfriend, depending on the context (something like buying gf -> girlfriend, good fight is after someone else says it to you (gf))
    lure: A type of social engineering where another player tries to cheat another player out of their items either by bringing them to the wildy/wilderness or just in trades

Keep it light, not every message you respond to will be directed at you, but you can decide if you want to respond.
</code></pre>

<p>Just covering some basics like minor lingo etc, but really what I want to make sure we see is we have
<li>Non-cringey responses with weird acronyms or language</li>
<li>Some basic knowledge of the game</li>
<li>Brevity</li>
And with that we'll ideally see how we perform out of the box. To experiment, I'll try out LLama3.2-11b, Llama3.1-8b, Qwen2.5-14b, Mistral-7b, llava-13b.
<br><br>Remember, we're mostly vibing it out, this is technically one of those tests where there "are no wrong answers", but based on size (read as: speed/performance)+ personal preference we'll decide what we move forward with.
<br><br>The prompts are either bait (e.g. scams), game knowledge questions, or just chatting (indeterminate responses).

    All bad, honestly. If we follow the actions of any models here, we'll be broke, dead, and lonely. <br>
    Of the model responses though, Mistral 
    seems to be the only one that seems to have <i>some</i> knowledge of the game, it's language is just off, so that's pretty manageable. 
    I was originally going to break down the individual responses, but since we're going on vibes, I'll focus in on improving Mistral!
</p>
<i>Aside: Cursor also generated the above table, and auto-populated a lot of the fields, and honestly they're pretty good (cohere 3.5 20241022)</i>

<p>
    I think we could squeeze more performance out with better prompting, but I want to focus on how we can improve the models.<br>
    We can either try knowledge enhancement with things like tools (search) and rag, or we can try to fine-tuning on in-game data to provide 
    better context for how to interact in the game. With two areas to focus in on, I want to keep this post scoped in so will focus on fine-tuning.
</p>
<h3>Game Data</h3>
<h4>Wiki</h4>
<p>
    Old school runescape it actually known for having one of the best wikis in modern MMOs, with so much detail and evolving information, 
    it's one of those games where while you're playing you have about 100 tabs open with different articles. This is going to be extremely valuable
    as it can be both a source of fine-tuning data, as well as a source of context for the models in future posts.<br><br>
    One issue is, there is no api, and unlike mainstream wikipedia there isn't a publicly avaiable data dump. However, it at least does provide 
    a convenient <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Special:AllPages?from=A+nice+key&hideredirects=1" target="_blank">"all pages"</a> page, which makes scraping pretty trivial!
</p>
<p>
    Using cursor, I built out <a href="https://github.com/MarkProjectRepo/osrs_wiki_crawl" target="_blank">this osrs wiki crawler</a>
    which crawls + parses into markdown. One of the bigger challenges is some of the pages have some dynamic elements, they have remainders 
    from prompts for people to suggest edits etc., so a lot of garbage is there and out-of-the-box packages just don't get us what we need (looking at you, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/" target="_blank">html2text</a>)
</p>
<p>
    So, this flow is actually a good use-case for cursor's Agentic flow, where it's able to pull files/context when it needs, rather than 
    me just having to statically provide something like a reference page, I can instead point it to the wiki, and say "go nuts" (just kidding, I prompted as follows):
</p>
<pre><code>@Web @https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Special:AllPages?from=&to=&namespace=0&hideredirects=1  
Given this wiki page which is a directory to articles for the game old school runescape, sample pages and come up with a way to parse 
the html of the pages in a way that extracts the descriptions, and characteristics of what they describe (e.g. item stats, facts, ...), 
and convert them to markdown (this is the hard part, but I believe in you). Please do so in python, and 
use any libraries that make sense (like beautifulsoup), but don't just assume one page is the same as the next
</code></pre>
<h4>Game data: Chat</h4>
<p>A method in the Client is key for this: <a href="https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-api/src/main/java/net/runelite/api/Client.java#L948" target="_blank">getChatLineMap</a>. 
<p>Since we have access either directly through the java methods, or through py4j, we can get the chat. I still haven't covered my data collection pattern yet, but I'm not gonna really focus on this still (<i>Eventually ‚Ñ¢ </i>), but we use it here so take that as a hint if interested.</p>
<p>High level though, I use a basic pub/sub model in python since there are characteristics of the game that means we don't need to worry 
    about collecting data more often than every 0.6 second.<br>Chat is a pretty slow updating process so for this data collection use-case, I'm not too worried about performance.<br>
    Every 0.6 seconds we just check to see if there are any new chat line items and from that we write that to a file, from which we can do some fine-tuning with (as long as we get enough chat data)
</p>
<p>We made 2 publishers for chat, one that just collects everything and tries to categorize it, and one that filters down to just the chat messages.</p>
<p>Below being the <a href="https://github.com/MarkProjectRepo/runelite-python/blob/main/src/runelite_python/runelite_data/message_pub.py#L6" target="_blank">MessagePublisher</a></p>
<pre><code>for message in messages.iterator():
    message = MessageNode(message)
    name = self._clean_text(message.get_name())
    value = self._clean_text(message.get_value())
    sender = self._clean_text(message.get_sender())

    msg_data = {
        "name": name,
        "value": value,
        "sender": sender,
        "type": self._message_type(sender, name)
    }
    if self.filter_func and self.filter_func(msg_data):
        msg_data = self.filter_func(msg_data)
    processed_messages.append(msg_data)
</code></pre>
<p>Then a convenience class that inherits all from MessagePublisher, but hardcodes in the filter function to only collect chat messages and turns the line items into cleaner chat strings.</p>
<pre><code>class ChatPublisher(MessagePublisher):
    def __init__(self, client: Client, publisher_name: str = None):
        filter_func = lambda x: x['sender'] == None and x['name']
        super().__init__(client, publisher_name, 1, filter_func)
        self.chat_length = 0

    def get_message(self):
        messages = super().get_message()
        res = messages[self.chat_length:]
        self.chat_length = len(messages)

        return '\n'.join([f"{m['name']}: {m['value']}" for m in res])
</code></pre>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YrUOxgV.gif" alt="Changing the name in the chat">
    <figcaption>Collecting chat data from a semi-active location</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The code is a little more verbose with lame boilerplate (not crazy), so I put it in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/MarkProjectRepo/b6f553629adfe6b7cbecdd91c9be24cb" target="_blank">gist</a>,
 but going over the important snippet
</p>
<pre><code>client = Client(jclient)
messages = client.get_messages()
try:
    for message in messages.iterator():
        message = MessageNode(message)
        message.set_name(args.name)
        message.set_value(args.msg)
except Exception as e:
    pass
client.refresh_chat()
</code></pre>
<p>So, using the same client as in the prior post, we can easily get all the messages in the client, and from the below gif, we can change them!</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZKJA6vo.gif" alt="Changing the name in the chat">
    <figcaption>Changing the chat data</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sick. Some annoying things to note, the messages are just... null sometimes, I messed around a little bit with checks but not much seems to catch it for whatever reason, so though I'm not a fan of the try/catch, I can live with it for now.</p>
<p>So, we can see all the chats, we can edit them, sending is a little bit more annoying, as we need the client thread.</p>
